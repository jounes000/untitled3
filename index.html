<h1> Horse</h1>

<p> Horses and humans have an ancient relationship.
    Asian nomads probably domesticated the first horses some 4,000 years ago, and the animals remained essential to many human societies until the advent of the engine
    . Horses still hold a place of honor in many cultures, often linked to heroic exploits in war. </p>

    <h2> The story</h2>
    <blockquote>At the age of 14 I finally got my first horse. She was a beautiful mare called Stained Gold, I called her Gold for short. She was a gorgeous 14.3hh, palomino Quarter horse and had a heart of gold, hence the name Gold. One day we went riding in the forest and I rode Gold, nobody was with me and nobody knew I was out riding. We had a go at galloping through the forest and I was fine, it was when we started jumping logs that things went wrong.
